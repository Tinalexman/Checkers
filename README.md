A locally networked game that you can play with your friends
You can connect loaclly through the wifi on an android device. All you need to do is connect both computers running the game to the android device's hotspot connection. 
Then you run the Host.java file in the background.
NOTE: The two players should click on their respective player button(Player One or Player Two) before the Host.java file is run to ensure fast connectivity.
This app enables messaging.
You are able to send and likewise recieve messages from your opponent.
It also has sound, sfx and hints enabled by default.
You can tweak the settings by hitting the ALT key.
You can set your player name and other settings you want from the settings section
NOTE: You cannot change your player name when the game is being run, but you can edit other properties.
NOTE: The moment any player quits the game, the game is cancelled and the other player is taken back to the main menu to await another player.
It has some few bugs which would have been eliminataed by the next update.
But basically, it's a fun game to play.
Enjoy playing it as much as I enjoyed writing it.
